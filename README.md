# EmployeeManagerApp

A simple C# Console App for managing employees, built using the SOLID principles for clean and maintainable code.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Add, update, delete, and list employees
- Search employees by name
- Count total employees
- Department management via extensions (Open/Closed Principle)

---

## ðŸ§± SOLID Principles Applied

### âœ… S â€“ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class has a single clear responsibility:

- `EmployeeRepository` â€” Handles storing and managing employee data.
- `EmployeeSearch` â€” Performs name-based employee searches.
- `Menu` â€” Manages user interaction and menus.
- `DepartmentMenu` (extension) â€” Adds department management without changing the core code.

This separation ensures low coupling and high cohesion.

---

### âœ… O â€“ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The app supports extensibility via the `IMenuExtension` interface. New features like managing departments can be added without modifying the existing `Menu` class.

- You can add new menu options (e.g. `DepartmentMenu`) by registering them as extensions.
- The main logic remains untouched, making it easy to scale and maintain.
